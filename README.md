**Description of the Project:** The main character of the game will be a dot. There will be a sentence and the dot will be trying to reach the end of this sentence. The letters inside this sentence will be the obstacles the dot has to overjump, within a time limit. If the dot can't reach the end of the sentence within the given time period, the game will be over. 
There will be several sntences that will be specified beforehand by us. Everytime the game starts, a random sentence will be chosen and the dot will have to reach the end of this sentence.
