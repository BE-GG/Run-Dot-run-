**Description of the Project:** The main character of the game will be a dot. There will be a sentence and the dot will be trying to reach the end of this sentence. There will be the obstacles such as erasers, sparks and fading letters which the dot has to overjump, within a limited time. The dot will have limited number of lives. If the dot can't reach the end of the sentence within the given time period or it uses all of its lives, the game will be over. Game will provide different levels which will include different obstacles and in addition, different bonuses, such as life bonus and time bonus.
There will be several sntences that will be specified beforehand by us. Everytime the game starts, a random sentence will be chosen and the dot will have to reach the end of this sentence.
